Description: 
The `image_model.py` file contains the implementation of the image processing model used in this project. It includes functions for image classification, feature extraction, and image manipulation.

### Usage

```python
# Import the ImageModel class
from image_model import ImageModel

# Create an instance of the model
model = ImageModel()

# Load an image
image = model.load_image('path/to/image.jpg')

# Classify the image
classification_result = model.classify_image(image)

# Extract features from the image
features = model.extract_features(image)

# Perform image manipulation
manipulated_image = model.manipulate_image(image, parameter1, parameter2)
